# Changelog

BaklaVue uses [Semantic Release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/) to automatically version and publish packages. Changelogs are generated from commit messages that follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

## Packages

BaklaVue is a monorepo with two independently versioned packages:

- **@baklavue/ui** — Vue 3 components for the Baklava Design System
- **@baklavue/composables** — Composable utilities for Vue 3

Each package has its own release cycle and changelog.
